Assignment 4: Building an App Using Django Rest Framework Backend and a React Frontend

## Introduction

This assignment is to help you practice the skills you have gained from the first chapter of Building RESTful Python Web Services. 

## Specification

Build a simple Todo List app with a Django REST Framework backend and any kind of mobile app framework (Android, iOS, or React Native) as your frontend. 

## Setup

You will start by building a standard Django app:

- Install Django with pipenv
- Create a new project
- Create a new app
- Configure your local database

## Todo

I have researched a tutorial that will take you through the processes involved in transforming a Django app into a REST API that can be consumed by a frontend. The tutorial can be found [here](https://wsvincent.com/django-rest-framework-react-tutorial/). Use this tutorial to build your first Django API. This tutorial uses a React framework. As part of the learning process, you might have to make some changes and/or Google some things to successfully complete this assignment.

## Submission

Submit a Word document that contains the screenshots of the items listed on the grading rubric and a link to your GitHub repository for this assignment.
